<li>If the master course has no expiration date, the enrolment in the target course will also not expire.</li>
<li>If the user accesses the target course directly from the course catalog (without going through the subcourse link), the standard Moodle behavior applies: the user will not be able to access unless enrolled or self-enrolment is enabled.</li>
